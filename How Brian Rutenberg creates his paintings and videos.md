In this Every article [Following the ‘White-hot Fire Inside of You’](https://every.to/superorganizers/following-the-white-hot-fire-inside-of-you) the New York artist [Brian Rutenberg](http://www.brianrutenbergart.com/) talks about his creative process, his productivity, and the reason for doing his [Studio Visit YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@thomgains1727/videos). There’s so much in this article that rings true and fundamental. For creators, for writers, for reaching excellence through practice.

This selection of section titles gives you a good preview of what he shares:

- A schedule is the only thing a painter can rely on
- Creativity is born of limitations, not freedom
- When I get blocked in my work, I just quit
- There is no upside to a fear of failure
- Purpose is way more powerful than inspiration
- The process of making videos helps me in every aspect of what I do
