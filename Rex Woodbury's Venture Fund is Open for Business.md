The [Digital Native newsletter](https://www.digitalnative.tech/) is my go-to resource for digital technology and markets from a Gen Z perspective. Its author, [Rex Woodbury](https://twitter.com/rex_woodbury), who previously worked at [Index Ventures](https://www.indexventures.com/), has recently launched his own early-stage venture firm, [Daybreak](https://www.daybreakventures.com/). They just opened for business, and you can read all about it [here](https://www.digitalnative.tech/p/seed-investing-the-state-of-the-union).

If I had a budget for risky pre-seed investments, I'd definitely consider allocating a portion to his fund. Over the years, Rex has shown a deep understanding of technology and how it intersects with the _digital native_ generations. By scrolling through his [Substack archive](https://www.digitalnative.tech/archive) from the beginning, you'll notice his eye for spotting emerging trends like TikTok, remote work, VR, the Metaverse, gaming, and creator platforms. His insights into these areas of future growth are consistently on point.

For accredited investors in the USA, expressing interest is possible via [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdA-keeYQH4VaIFrZKawXbo_WPoYq4A_8TbeEWfkRlGQ61IvA/viewform?usp=sf_link). Unfortunately, I have to sit this one out. While it's impossible to predict the trajectory of his fund, I believe Rex has the necessary qualities to have a chance.
