When you accidentally delete text on your iPhone, there is a way to bring it back. The undo and redo functions are available throughout the system via a three-finger tap on the screen. This works in message fields, website forms, and almost any app.

- Tapping with three fingers once brings up a floating menu at the top of the screen, featuring undo, redo, cut, copy, and paste buttons.
- A quick double tap with three fingers undoes the last action without displaying the menu.
- Swiping left and right with three fingers allows you to perform multiple undos (left) and redos (right) without showing the menu.

Frederiko showcases this in his excellent iOS 13 review at [Text Selection, Gestures, and Keyboard](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/28/#text-selection-gestures-and-keyboard). All this was introduced to replace the fun but slightly awkward [shake gesture](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5S4gvmeg-yM) that can still perform an undo. Just the other day I saw Jasmin doing it and it prompted the idea for this tip.
