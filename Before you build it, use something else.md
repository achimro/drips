Do you have ideas for a new app or product? I currently have an idea for a combined note-taking and newsletter app. Instead of talking to a developer and attempting to build it, I try to create it with existing apps first. This approach has many advantages:

- You can build it right away without external help
- You learn about potential alternatives
- You can show a working prototype to other people
- You see the shortcomings of existing tools in the context of your particular idea

Trickle taught me many things but a major one was how difficult it is to create an app. It is very time and money-intensive. Instead of going down that path again, Iâ€™ll ask myself from now on whether I can create something similar with existing tools.
