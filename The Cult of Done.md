Productivity is a beast. We all need to get things done in order to work and live. But when we focus on our productivity, it can quickly feel as if we suck the soul out of our existence as human beings. Well, not anymore after you read this:

The Cult of Done is a manifest that was written, so [its authors say](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13), back in 2009 in 20 minutes because "we only had 20 minutes to get it done". It consists of 13 short statements, which are exceptionally well explained in the YouTube video [How to Get Started: The Cult of Done](https://youtu.be/bJQj1uKtnus?si=0-Vx8fsuwWmXYZRd).

The creator of the video, who is a programmer by trade, leads with the statement "I think of many of the 13 principles every single day, as I write these videos, produce my audiofiction podcasts, and write music or code for any of my projects." When I look at his various forms of creative output, I'd say he's a master of productivity.

Do yourself and the world a favor and watch the video at least once. And then get things done with a little more lightness.
