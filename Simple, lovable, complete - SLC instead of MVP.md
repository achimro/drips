After reading [this article](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/) I replaced the term Minimal Viable Product (MVP) with Simple Lovable Complete (SLC) in my vocabulary.

> Your customers hate MVPs. Make a SLC instead. “MVP” is a selfish process, abusing customers so you can “learn.” SLC is an alternate philosophy that results in fast, validated learning, that customers love.

Create a very simple product, make it lovable and complete within its simple boundaries. Then share it with other people. SLC can be pronounced “slick”, which makes it even more fun to talk about it.

Thank you [James](https://turnercreative.ck.page), for bringing this to my attention and having conversations about it.
