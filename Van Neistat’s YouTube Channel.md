What would an analog YouTube channel look like? Probably like the [channel of Van Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/@vanneistat), the brother of [Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/@casey), one of the early major YouTube stars. Van - that’s his first name - is a character. A spirited man. That name fits him and his YouTube channel like a glove. He fixes things. He builds things. He’s an artist, a professional video editor, and he creates his own music. He’s opinionated but, as far as I can tell, his convictions are helpful and based on reasonable experiences from his workshop. I enjoyed already many of his videos. They are creative, personal, edgy, and entertaining. Videos like his are a great example of how to use the medium of video to not only talk about things but actually show things. It is captivating.

This is an [intro to the channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT6wYbaRrlQ) and here’s what his brother Casey [says about him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgYVuXaihNs). Good examples of his strong opinions are [5 Principles of Organization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncZ1mO8mA44) and [Essential Travel Packing Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQVqNfX5y_k&t=28s). The videos on his [Revolving Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziFHJLmN7rs) and [How to Build Shelves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxBhEj4HCi4)represent his style of building things well. Oh, and a gem is this [rant on people who turn up late](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm4mr7jzSpQ).

It’s creators like him who make YouTube so great for me.
