I have been watching ePaper devices like the [Remarkable](https://remarkable.com/) for quite some time. When my friend Kathrin asked me for advice, I theorized that it could be a new space: digital handwriting is easy to erase, works with cut and paste, and supports organization in notes. All this with hardly any distraction. The Kindle Scribe is relatively cheap, it's powered by Amazon’s huge development resources and supports the Kindle ecosystem of books. Intriguing. So I ordered one in the Prime sale (16 Gig, premium pen, no cover) to explore. And so far I love it. It helps me think, by sketching, writing, etc. It is a new space for notes and drafts. Very tactile and without distraction. A tool for thought. It has a lot of potential.

Here's a [helpful review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm4A721uhfw) and [Brandon Boswell on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me88APYahZM) does a great job of comparing ePaper devices in general.
