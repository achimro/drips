This [interactive article](https://ncase.me/trust/) by Nicky Case is profound! It made me realize how repeat transactions that create win-win situations are a requirement for a functional society. Blame game theory! Only under specific conditions it does make mathematical sense for all actors to behave trustworthy. This explains why you should work with the same people, avoid miscommunication but also avoid people that led you down repeatedly. Brilliantly made! Available in many languages and hence suitable for children in many languages.
