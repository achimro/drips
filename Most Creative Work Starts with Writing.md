I've heard many times that writing is an essential skill. This is a powerful reminder of its foundational role across diverse creative fields, be it filmmaking, video essays, teaching, songwriting, or game development.

The skill of writing and storytelling remains a pivotal force driving creativity. Writing is in essence a conversation with yourself. It can clarify your thinking and help to create better results in any medium.
