Nuclear energy is an insanely complex topic. Many smart people I know regard nuclear as a carbon-friendly source of energy. They are not against renewables. But they uphold nuclear power as important part of the energy mix of the future. In Germany the conservative party of Angela Merkel decided to phase out nuclear power, to the delight of the Green Party. So the topic is front and center and I frequently find myself in the middle of a conversation about it.

The podcast series Age of Miracles ([written introduction](https://www.notboring.co/p/age-of-miracles), [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/age-of-miracles/id1527421931?i=1000632801912), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5gCZQnbnnRtGdW3gKJPBlg?si=68ef5abd827c4d09)) lays out the arguments pro nuclear in a very reasonable, constructive, and approachable way. It's hosted by [Packy McCormick](https://twitter.com/packyM) of the [Not Boring](https://www.notboring.co/) newsletter and [Julia DeWahl](https://twitter.com/juliadewahl). The series is an insightful source to learn about the topic and understand what motivates nuclear energy advocates. After listening carefully and with an open mind I understand and even support most of the arguments brought up by the experts.

Though they do steelman and address criticism, I would love to see an equally refined argument laid out by nuclear critics. It feels to me like the risks need to be at least considered more carefully, specifically regarding unprecedented disasters. If you know a great sources covering the case against nuclear in a constructive way, please share them with me.

Abundant energy is an important goal for humanity. Nuclear could potentially play an important part.

What I don't see enough covered is risk. One example is the power plant Saporishia in Ukraine. It was obvious

Still it feels like the discussion would benefit from someone with the opposite opinion, who is equally smart. I recommend to listen to this with an open mind to broaden your perspective for this important discussion.

I'm going to look out for experts who can argument the contra nuclear side. In the meantime I can state 

I am personally torn whether nuclear energy should be part of the future, with a tendency to put priority on fully renewable and more modular ways of energy production, where the risks are less severe. 

Germany decided to ban nuclear fusion under the Conservative Party of Angela Merkel. The Green Party is strictly against it.
