This is how you tolerate a cold shower without pain. I call this the ACAC (As-Cold-as-Comfortable) method:

1. Finish your regular shower.
2. Gradually decrease the water temperature, only going as cold as you're comfortable with. Listen to your bodily sensations, not fear.
3. Go as slow as you like. You'll find your body adjusting, allowing you to go colder as you thought. 
5. Once you've found your lowest comfortable point, go back to hot, even very hot, for 10-20 seconds.
6. Now return to your previous cold point, exploring whether you can go slightly colder.

Repeatedly practicing this can quickly increase your cold tolerance. This year, I comfortably achieved maximum cold exposure within 2 weeks. It may vary for beginners.

Stepping out after an ACAC shower leaves you feeling invigorated, and even cold winter bathrooms feel cozy. Give it a try!
