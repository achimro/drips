If you'd like to dive a bit more into biographies - and you should - start with [this podcast series by Ben Willson](https://www.takeoverpod.com). Ben picks out great leaders from all over history and explores the actions and traits that made them great. I adore his unique narration style. He speaks in a conversational and captivating voice. It sound refined but at the same time personal, like listening to a very smart friend. He uses everyday language and often puts data, events and actions in context with today's culture. This makes the actions and events of the featured personalities easier to grasp.

Compared with Dan Carlings excellent Hardcore History show, Ben's episodes are lighter and easier to digest. I'd recommend to start at the beginning and listen your way forward as I think especially the older episodes are really great and shouldn't be skipped. Looking back I learned most from Horatio Nelson, William Randolph Hurst, Thomas Edison, Joan of Arc and to my surprise Brigham Young. But I also appreciated episodes about Vladimir Putin, Steve Jobs, Alexander the Great, or Learnardo Davinci. Seriously, they are all great, so just pick a personality that speaks to you and give it a go (e.g. on [Apple Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/id1333158713?mt=2&ls=1) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1gqvQ7h7BxNSVoQVTnwihr)).
