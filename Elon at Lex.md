I've always enjoyed the long-form interviews of Elon Musk by Lex Fridman ([#1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEv99vxKjVI), [#2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smK9dgdTl40), [#3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxREm3s1scA)). This was his fourth time on the show and I was pleasantly surprised that I still do.

After what has happened with Twitter/X, I expected to see a changed Elon. I thought power might have corrupted him, leading him to become more political. But that was not what I saw. Elon was still as smart and funny as usual. He came across as honest and kind at heart, even showing a little more vulnerability than usual. He also [clarified his political stance](https://youtu.be/JN3KPFbWCy8?si=HATuGka3ST0B3WV_&t=6900) directly. I don’t share his leadership for X, but I see how it is rooted in his commitment to free speech.

My highlights were his [advice to Israel](https://youtu.be/JN3KPFbWCy8?si=E9Mi-xpBz_Nu9X3D&t=288), his insane [gaming skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN3KPFbWCy8&t=3322s), SpaceX’s hilarious [maritime requirements](https://youtu.be/JN3KPFbWCy8?si=swTdHqtl8qFttaJG&t=4729) concerning sharks, whales, and seals, the bias in [negative news](https://youtu.be/JN3KPFbWCy8?si=wHyqAZTzCbFitGUD&t=7303), and his emphasis (again) that [people would not want to trade places](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN3KPFbWCy8&t=7948s) with him. (All links with timestamps).

Lex is an extremely kind and calm host. I find he gives room for guests to show their personal side. It’s not about journalism or debate, but rather a conversation between friends that you can listen in on. If you want to get a feel for Elon Musk’s personality, listen to this.

Elon plays Diablo 4 and they talk about how he struggles to defeat Uber Lilith in the Eternal Realm, something insanely hard. Elon recounts how he was once a world class Quake player, even winning price money with a team. They mention Elden Ring, a very hard but and impressivly beautiful game. He actually did it the next day.
