I’ve been following [Peter Zeihan's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ZeihanonGeopolitics) channel for quite some time and enjoy his takes on Geopolitics. I've watched his channel grow in subscribers from around 20k to currently 650k. His videos are a beautiful example of how it doesn’t have to be complicated to create a YouTube channel.

Peter records 4-10 minute videos of himself with his phone, mostly while hiking in the mountains of Colorado.

Many of his viewers are professionals and Peter is frequently booked as an expert on geopolitics from all kinds of industries. His thoughts are relevant and due to writing many books, he has a profound knowledge to share.

But the important insight is this: his personal and low production-value videos are not stopping him from being taken seriously. Quite the opposite. I notice how I feel close to him and build a relationship. I think it is not despite but because of this style that he succeeded so quickly.
