Do you want to build up more strength? I do and that's why I'm doing a 4-week course called [STABLE](https://www.wayoftherope.com/products/stable) by Tim Shieff and I am very happy with the progress. I decided to prioritize stability before strength training, because it feels like an important first step. Once I build a foundation of subtle strength I can continue with heavier exercises. Tim talks about the reasoning in a conversation with a fellow YouTuber ([link with timestamp]( https://youtu.be/DXEyU59pKcU?si=_LYd5tEhDwNHBuPQ&t=478)).

All you need is a Swiss Ball. I am using a fancy one from [VLUV](https://vluv.de/collections/bol-der-sitzball) that I already had as sitting ball. It looks very stylish because of its fabric cover. You can see the [exercises of week one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8uFwySESR8&t=4s). Tim's course is very affordable and comes in the form of a PDF with explanations and links to unlisted YouTube videos. I enjoy following along the realtime exercise videos doing a full session with Tim. Right now, I'm still doing the week one exercises for the fourth week in a row. It feels like I still build up strength and balance with the exercises, getting a little better everyday. It's actually a lot of fun.

Part of the week one workout is the [eyes closed balance exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8zKayyvdQE), that Peter Attia prescribes in his book Outlive. I'm happy to tick this box, at the same time.
