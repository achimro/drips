Thanks to [Dirk](https://dirk-lehmann.com) I currently work my way through the book of two Stanford professors, Dave Evans and Bill Burnett called [Designing Your Life](https://designingyour.life/the-book/). It shows how to apply design thinking principles to your own life. The goal of this framework is defined like this:

> When you have a well-designed life and someone asks you, “How’s it going?,” you have an answer. You can tell that person that your life is going well, and you can tell how and why.

Some of my highlights from the book include wicked problems, reframing, problem finding, acceptance, getting unstuck, gauges, Workview, Lifeviewk, and [[Life Odysseys]].

Especially relevant for me: "Designers don't think they're way forward. Designers build their way forward." And the exercises in the book show how to do that.

Shout out to Dirk, Kinda, Paulo and Semih who are going through this process with me.
