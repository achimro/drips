What a wonderful and thoughtful essay about electric bike ownership. [Electric Bike, Stupid Love of My Life — by Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/essays/electric_bikes/) His heartfelt delight about riding his ebike makes all the usual arguments against owning one sound pathetic. Too expensive? It's cheating? You don’t enjoy riding bicycles? Read this and see those boring arguments dissolve in a most charming way.

> Has money ever bought as much delight as the delight of an electric bike?
